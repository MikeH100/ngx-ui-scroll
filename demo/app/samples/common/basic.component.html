      Speaking of what impact could <em>Settings</em> have on the Scroller behavior,
      we need to get an idea of its behavior before any settings applied.
      This demo is the very basic example with no <em>Settings</em> provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's first investigate the demo's log.
      The visible part of the viewport contains 10 items in accordance with CSS:
      10 items of 25px each are equal to 250px of the viewport height.
      <em>Datasource.get</em> log shows that there were 3 requests
      of 5, 10 and 5 items on the initial load (before any scrolling).
      So we have 20 DOM elements initially:
      15 downward items with positive indexes and 5 upward negative items.
      20 items result in 500px and this is the initial viewport scrollable size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viewport scrollable size value can increase only;
      as we scroll more and more, items flow through the <em>Datasource.get</em>.
      In this demo the <em>Datasource</em> is unlimited,
      it produces items with indexes from -Infinity to +Infinity.
      The number of DOM elements in the viewport is not constant,
      but it fluctuates around the initial value during scrolling (20-31).
      The core concept of the virtualization is to keep as small number of real items as needed
      while the scrollable size of the viewport can be very big.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do we have 3 requests initially,
      why the first one is about only 5 items,
      why at least 10 items are invisible?
      This is how the <em>*uiScroll</em> works and further reading should shed light on the details.
      But we need to know that the default behavior could be changed via <em>Settings</em> object.
