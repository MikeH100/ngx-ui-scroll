      Each <em>Adapter</em> method runs the <em>uiScroll Workflow</em>
      that handles multiple internal processes, some of which may be asynchronous.
      In order to deal with such asynchronicity,
      the return value of the <em>Adapter</em> method is a <em>Promise</em>
      that is resolved when all internal processes
      triggered by the <em>Adapter</em> are terminated.
      Return value has following type
    </p>

    <pre>{{returnValueType}}</pre>

    <p>
      - <em>success</em>: specifies whether the <em>Adapter</em> method completed successfully or not;
      for example, if some method is invoked with wrong arguments, no error will be thrown,
      but we'll get <em>success:&nbsp;false</em> in the result;
      <br>
      - <em>details</em>: contains error message in case <em>success</em> is <em>false</em>;
      <br>
      - <em>immediate</em>: specifies whether the <em>Adapter</em> method completed immediately or not;
      for example, if <em>Adapter.remove</em> won't remove any items, then it will be
      terminated immediately and we'll get <em>immediate:&nbsp;true</em> in the result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note, <em>immediate:&nbsp;false</em> does not necessarily mean that the <em>Adapter</em> method
      worked asynchronously. But in any case, if there is any logic that needs to be run after
      the Adapter method completes its job, it is highly recommended
      to implement an explicit sequence like this:
