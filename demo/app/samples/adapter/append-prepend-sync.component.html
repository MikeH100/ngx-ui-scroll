      Along with <em>items</em> parameter both
      <em>Adapter.append</em> and <em>Adapter.prepend</em> methods
      have <em>eof</em>/<em>bof</em> parameter
      which is optional and which prevents rendering of new items
      when the end of the dataset (if we are speaking of <em>append</em>) or
      beginning of the dataset (<em>prepend</em> case) is not reached. See also
      <a
        [routerLink]="['/', adapterScope.id]"
        fragment="{{adapterPropsScope.map.bofEof.id}}"
      >bof/eof demo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's discuss <em>{{prependCallSample}}</em> case.
      If <em>bof</em> is set to <em>true</em> and the beginning of the dataset is reached
      (no more items can be fetched in backward direction), then
      new items will be injected immediately.
      Otherwise, new items will not appear, they will be virtualized:
      viewport backward padding element size will be increased in accordance with
      the number of new items multiplied by the average item size.
      The same is true for <em>{{appendCallSample}}</em>
      adjusted for forward direction and forward padding element.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this demo we want the datasource to be consistent with the dataset changes made during append/prepend.
      For example, to synchronize some remote changes (appearance of new messages in a chat channel)
      with the end user's Viewport.
      This demo implements two approaches of such synchronization:
      based on internal id of item's data ("Component" tab)
      and based on natural index of data array ("Component 2" tab).
      The dataset is changed per each <em>doAppend</em> / <em>doPrepend</em> calls
      destructively by <em>unshift</em> and <em>push</em> Array's methods.
      This will guarantee stable data flow from the App component to the Scroller.
      Another examples of such synchronization could be found in
      <a
        [routerLink]="['/', adapterScope.id]"
        fragment="{{adapterMethodsScope.map.remove.id}}"
      >remove</a> and
      <a
        [routerLink]="['/', adapterScope.id]"
        fragment="{{adapterMethodsScope.map.insert.id}}"
      >insert</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
