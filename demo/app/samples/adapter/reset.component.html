    <p>
      The <em>Adapter.reset</em> method is designed to reset the internal state
      of the Scroller. It differs from the <em>Adapter.reload</em> because it
      re-instantiates all internal entities, which is equivalent to destroying
      the Scroller and re-creating it again via <em>ngIf</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method has 1 optional argument: <em>datasource</em> object. By passing
      it, we tell the Scroller that we want to use a new datasource. If the
      argument is not passed, the old Datasource will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      All fields of the <em>datasource</em> argument are optional. Missing parts
      of a new Datasource will be taken from the original one. For instance, in
      this demo only <em>settings</em> field is passed:
      <em>Adapter.reset(&#123; settings &#125;)</em>. This sets new
      <em>startIndex</em> and <em>bufferSize</em> settings while
      <em>Datasource.get</em> remains pristine. It affects the value of the DOM
      elements counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important note!</b> Do not re-assign the Datasource at the App
      component level, <em>this.datasource</em> must keep the same reference
      before and after reset. So
      <em>this.datasource&nbsp;=&nbsp;...</em> expressions are prohibited after
      reset, for it will make the Adapter subscriptions broken. The Scroller
      maintains Datasource params and provides the Adapter consistency across
      the reset. Even in case of passing a new instance of Datasource:
