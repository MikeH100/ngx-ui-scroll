      <em>Adapter.remove</em> method allows to remove items from current buffer or/and virtually.
      The argument of this method is an object of the following type:
    </p>
    <pre>{{argumentsDescription}}</pre>
    <p>
      The <em>predicate</em> option is a function applying to each item in the buffer.
      If the return value is true, the item will be removed.
      The argument of the predicate has <em>ItemAdapter</em> type, and
      in this demo we have two versions of <em>predicate</em> using for
      removing by id and by index:
    </p>
    <pre>{{predicateDescription}}</pre>
    <p>
      Indexes are adjusted each time we perform a removing via Adapter.
      It is impossible to remove item with id = 5 twice,
      because there is only one item with id = 5.
      But we may remove item with index = 5 as many times
      as many items we have after this index. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a continuous series of items can be removed at a time using <em>predicate</em>.
      So, if you need to remove items 1, 2, 3 and 5,
      you need to call this method twice: once for 1, 2, 3 and then for 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of <em>predicate</em> running over buffered items,
      it is possible to remove items by <em>indexes</em>.
      It has no sequence limitation.
      This method works with both buffered and virtual items.
      For example, if we have [1..10] buffered items (they are rendered)
      and [11..100] virtual items (emulated via forward padding element
      which size corresponds to 90 virtual items) and then we perform
      <em>Adapter.remove(&#123; indexes: [100] &#125;)</em>, we'll have
      the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>buffer is not affected</li>
      <li>the visible part of the viewport remains the same</li>
      <li>
        size of the forward padding is reduced by the size of the 100th item,
        so the scrollable area becomes slightly smaller
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Indexes decrease by default, and the next option (<em>increase</em>)
      allows to change the default indexes adjustment strategy.
      By setting <em>increase</em> to <em>true</em>, we tell the <em>uiScroll</em>
      that we want to increase indexes of the items before the removed one(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      The very important thing is to synchronize the datasource with the changes
      we are making over the <em>uiScroll</em> buffer via <em>Adapter.remove</em>.
      Generally this is the App component responsibility,
      and in this demo it is done by the <em>removeFromDatasource</em> method.
      It removes 1 item from the initial dataset,
      and decrements the value of the right border.
