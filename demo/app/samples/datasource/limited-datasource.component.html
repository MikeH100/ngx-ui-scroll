    <p>
      The datasource could be limited. In this sample we have only 1000 items in the dataset:
      from -99 to 900 including 0. If at some point the <em>uiScroll</em> will request
      this datasource for, say, 10 items started from -105 index, then
      the result will consist of only 4 items: -99, -98, -97, -96.
      It is also important to return empty array if we are out of range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option of how to limit the datasource is to use
      <a
        [routerLink]="['/', minMaxDemoConfig.scope]"
        fragment="{{minMaxDemoConfig.id}}"
      >minIndex and maxIndex settings</a>;
      this way the implementation of the <em>Datasource.get</em> method could remain unlimited
      as the <em>uiScroll</em> will not request for items that are out of
      [<em>minIndex</em>; <em>maxIndex</em>] range.
