    <p>
      If we are not going to deal with negative indexes,
      we can fix the datasource left boundary at 1 (or 0 depends on your needs).
      This is a particular case of limited datasource discussed above
      with only <em>MIN</em> value set up. Also, positive limitation
      could be alternatively achieved by assigning 1 (or 0) value to
      <a
        [routerLink]="['/', settingsScope.minMaxIndexes.scope]"
        fragment="{{settingsScope.minMaxIndexes.id}}"
      >minIndex and maxIndex settings</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that if 0 index is the left boundary of the dataset,
      then it seems reasonable to assign 0 value to
      <a
        [routerLink]="['/', settingsScope.startIndex.scope]"
        fragment="{{settingsScope.startIndex.id}}"
      >startIndex setting</a> too,
      because the default <em>startIndex</em> value is 1.
